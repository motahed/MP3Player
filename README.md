# MP3Player
This mp3player is essentially the same as the one that is  posted in   http://delphi.about.com/od/multimedia/l/aa112800a.htm . I just added some bells and whistles to it. It can fast forward and reverse by seconds. Mark the desired location and jump to arbitrary location. Repeat a favorite song. Play random files so make it more like a radio station but no commercials.
